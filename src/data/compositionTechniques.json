    "description": "The first rule to learn as a beginner is the rule of thirds in photography. I would like to say that this rule emphasizes more on the position of the subjects in the frame. <br><br> According to this rule, you can position your subjects in any of the four intersecting points of the grid formed by two vertical and horizontal lines. <br><br> You can also align your subjects along any of these four lines. If you have a horizon level in the image, which is quite common in landscape images, you can place the horizon on any of these lines to draw the viewer’s attention. <br><br> This rule is of the popular types of composition in photography. <br><br> The bird (Snow Partridge) is framed using the rule of thirds. The two points of intersection of the grid lines, along with one vertical line fall on the bird’s body. The bird’s eye also lies on the top horizontal grid line."
